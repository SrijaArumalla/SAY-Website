            <h1>This is how it started...</h1>
            <h3><i>Some people associate social work with casework and, by analogy, Child Protective Services. A social worker can indeed make a career<br> working in this capacity, but social work as a profession is much broader. Modern social work grew out of attempts – often by <br>women, often by volunteers -- to heal social ills. Poverty was frequently at the root of what they tackled – and yet not always. Nearly 100 years ago, social workers were helping veterans who had been traumatized in World War I. Today’s social workers are in hospitals, health clinics, schools,<br> various social service organizations. They serve the sick as 
                well as the disadvantaged. Some offer counseling services through their own <br>private practices.<br><br><br><br>

​

Inspired by the historic events, we came up with heroic idea to provide services along with our friends and started the Social Army Youth Association on 20 January 2019.Starting from the day of establishment we provided many services including food drives,feeding stray dogs and similar activities.We also celebrate special occasions like Independence Day, Children's Day.Growing day by day we are so excited to provide services to the needy..
